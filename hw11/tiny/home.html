<h1>CSAPP:3e Tiny Web Server</h1>
<i>CMU</i>&nbsp;<span>15213</span>

<p>
    This is the home directory for the Tiny server, a 200-line Web
    server that we use in "15-213: Intro to Computer Systems" at Carnegie
    Mellon University.  Tiny uses the GET method to serve static content
    (text, HTML, GIF, and JPG files) out of ./ and to serve dynamic
    content by running CGI programs out of ./cgi-bin. The default 
    page is home.html (rather than index.html) so that we can view
    the contents of the directory from a browser.
</p>
<p>    
    Tiny is neither secure nor complete, but it gives students an
    idea of how a real Web server works. Use for instructional purposes only.
